\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced a combinations of Recursive Neural Network and Convolution Neural Network for sentence-level sentiment analysis.
We did experiments with both tree-structured and sequential Recursive Neural Networks.
Using Standford Sentiment Treebank, we demonstrated that the combinations are able to outperform most pure Convolution and Recursive Neural Networks.

Additionally, in attempt to improve vector presentations of words, we trained Glove vectors on the gigantic Amazon Reviews dataset (Glove Amazon).
We have demonstrated Glove Amazon is good for models on binary setting but can be harmful for them in fine-grained setting.

Given the success of Glove Amazon, we will pre-train Multichannel CNN-LSTM as a language model on Amazon Reviews dataset.
