\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we investigated the combinations of Recursive Neural Network and Convolution Neural Network for sentence-level sentiment analysis. 
We did experiments with both tree-structured and sequential Recursive Neural Networks.
Using Standford Sentiment Treebank, we demonstrated that the combinations are able to outperform most Convolution and Recursive Neural Networks.
Additionally, in attempt to improve vector presentations of words, we trained Glove vectors on the gigantic Amazon Reviews dataset (Glove Amazon).
We have demonstrated that on binary setting, Glove Amazon helps single input-channel models to archive higher accuracy compared to the standard Glove.   
On fine-grained setting, we also showed that a combination of Glove Amazon and standard Glove is better than each of the word embeddings.

Given the success of Glove Amazon, we will pre-train Multichannel CNN-LSTM as a language model on Amazon Reviews dataset.
